The task of spam-letters definition. Spam is an unsolicited message, especially advertising, as well as
sending messages repeatedly on the same site. We have two important problems with spam
definition:
1. The spam-filter does not define spam-letter and user get some “potential dangerous” letter.
2. Also, important letters can be sent to spam folder, due to incorrect classification by the mail
filter.

Dataset (description, origin)
1. 48 continuous real [0,100] attributes of type word_freq_WORD
= percentage of words in the e-mail that match WORD, i.e. 100 * (number of times the WORD
appears in the e-mail) / total number of words in e-mail. A &quot;word&quot; in this case is any string of
alphanumeric characters bounded by non-alphanumeric characters or end-of-string.
2. 6 continuous real [0,100] attributes of type char_freq_CHAR]
= percentage of characters in the e-mail that match CHAR, i.e. 100 * (number of CHAR occurences)
/ total characters in e-mail
3. 1 continuous real [1,...] attribute of type capital_run_length_average
= average length of uninterrupted sequences of capital letters
4. 1 continuous integer [1,...] attribute of type capital_run_length_longest
= length of longest uninterrupted sequence of capital letters
5. 1 continuous integer [1,...] attribute of type capital_run_length_total
= sum of length of uninterrupted sequences of capital letters
= total number of capital letters in the e-mail
6. 1 nominal {0,1} class attribute of type spam
= denotes whether the e-mail was considered spam (1) or not (0), i.e. unsolicited commercial e-mail.

For solving classification task we used machine learning methods that is realized by MLlib is
Apache Spark's scalable machine learning library [1] in this project.
